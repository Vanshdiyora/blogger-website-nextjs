It's a perfect companion to our existing courses, in particular the fundamentals covered in Learn HTML and Learn CSS. As with all the other courses on web.dev, you don't need to work through the course from beginning to end. It works as a reference, if you just want to brush up on specifics. We'll be using the material to link to as background reading from other articles too. We hope you enjoy learning JavaScript!",
